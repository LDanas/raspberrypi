This is a repository dedicated on what I have done with my Raspberry that I recently have bought. 2024/07/17

### I've converted a folder within the Raspberry into a Network disc that I can use on my main computer, to transfer storage from my main PC to the Rasp.

Currently, I'm still thinking of what to do with it . . .

I installed a fswebcam module onto the Raspberry Pi, got a camera from my brother's room, and used it to connect it into one of the USB ports within the Pi. 

With the help of the NAS from both PC's, I'm now able to take pictures from the webcam and store it in the Shared folder.

Also, here's a picture of my cat

# Raspberry Pi-hole Adblock

So I went to see what else I could do with it, and I stumbled uponnn a Network-wide adblock. (This means pop-ups & stuff. Can't really remove Youtube Ads.)

From there on, I went to Pi-hole's [Documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net), and got myself the module, downloaded it within the Rasp Pi, went ahead and got my Web Host ready to see if the Querys are workin', in fact they weren't,
until I found out I have to change the DNS on my router settings within Fritzbox. Changed it, and Voila! Works like wonders

Of course it doesn't work THAT well when you go to like [Can you block it](https://canyoublockit.com/) But it still works if you watch like the news on the internet or stuff like that. Still, I like it though.
