### I've converted a folder within the Raspberry into a Network disc that I can use on my main computer, to transfer storage from my main PC to the Rasp.

Currently, I'm still thinking of what to do with it . . .

I installed a fswebcam module onto the Raspberry Pi, got a camera from my brother's room, and used it to connect it into one of the USB ports within the Pi. 

With the help of the NAS from both PC's, I'm now able to take pictures from the webcam and store it in the Shared folder.

Also, here's a picture of my cat
